Using run_analysis.R
======================

To run the script fist set your working directory to the root directory of the project.  Verify that the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset folder is present in the project's root directory.  Then use the source command to run the script.  This will create an output file named tidyDataAverage.txt containing an average of all the Mean and Standard Deviation entries for a particular Subject, Activity and Feature.

The script will install any of it's dependencies if they are not already present on the machine where it's run.
